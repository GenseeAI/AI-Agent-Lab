## Level 5: Autonomous Task Agents (Goal-Driven Executors)

Level 5 agents are given a high-level goal and autonomously plan, decompose, and execute tasks with minimal human oversight. They coordinate multiple tools and roles, verify information, and return comprehensive deliverables.

### What this level’s agents do
- Break goals into subtasks and plan execution
- Orchestrate tool use, web search, and calculations
- Verify freshness/accuracy and compile structured results

### Provided agent(s) in this level
- [Finance Assistant](Finance Assistant/README.md): A workforce-style multi-agent system for financial research, combining web search, calculations, snapshot verification, and structured reporting.
- [Keypoint Organizer](Keypoint Organizer/README.md): A research → review → summarization pipeline that turns complex documents into concise key points with sources and optional quality metrics.

### Getting started
- Review each agent’s README for setup, API keys, and example workflows.
