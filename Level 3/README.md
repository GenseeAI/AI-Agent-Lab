## Level 3: Tool-Using Agents (API/Environment Operators)

Level 3 agents augment their reasoning with external tools and data sources. They can browse the web, call APIs, query databases, and incorporate results into their answers. This level moves beyond pure conversation into action-taking.

### What this levelâ€™s agents do
- Decide when external information is needed
- Call web/APIs/tools to gather fresh or specialized data
- Ground responses in retrieved facts and cite sources when available

### Provided agent(s) in this level
- [QA-with-search](QA-with-search/README.md): Uses OpenAI for decision-making and the Tavily API for web search to answer questions that require up-to-date information, with source attribution.

### Getting started
- Review the agent-level README linked above for setup, API keys, and usage.
