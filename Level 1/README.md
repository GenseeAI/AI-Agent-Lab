## Level 1: Reactive Agents (Stateless Tools)

Level 1 agents respond directly to inputs without retaining memory across interactions. They are simple, reliable building blocks that turn prompts into immediate outputs. This level is ideal for tasks like single-shot Q&A, translation, or formatting where long-term context isn’t required.

### What this level’s agents do
- Answer questions or perform a task in a single turn
- Do not store or recall prior conversation context
- Produce fast, deterministic results given the same input

### Provided agent(s) in this level
- [QA-with-translate](QA-with-translate/README.md): A two-step agent that first answers your question and then translates the answer to a target language. Useful for multilingual Q&A or producing localized content quickly.

### Getting started
- Review the agent-level README linked above for setup, environment variables, and usage examples.
